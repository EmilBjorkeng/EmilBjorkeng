# Hello, Welcome!

- 👋 Hi, I’m Emil I'm 17 years old and live in Norway!
- 👀 I like to make small games in my freetime, mostly for fun or to learn. I also like to make websites, both front and back-end.
- 🌱 Outside of programming I really like playing video games, lisening to music and talk to friends!
- 🦊 Another intrests of mine would be foxes🦊, I just really like one #makefoxespetlegal
- ✨ I would say I have intermediate knowledge/experience in HTML/CSS/Javascript, Python and C/C++.
- 📘 Always eager to learn new things. So whenever I get the motivation to learn I will use some weeks to learn.
- ⚙️ My motivation is not very consistent. I often leave projects unfinished beacuse I get a new hyperfixation, but I *try* my best to at least finish my projects.
- 📫 I have a twitter I sometimes use [@EmilBjorkeng](https://twitter.com/EmilBjorkeng). So if you want to contact me I guess go there..
